## Sysmex data: Overview
* Main Aim: investigate proteomics markers of asthma and asthma
severity/subtypes.
* Overarching Aim: Explore which of the 23 proteins are jointly predictive of asthma status, subtype and severity 

## Steps
1. Data pre-processing, filtering and exploration
2. Exploratory analyses
3. Feature selection of each outcome of interest 
4. Devising a clinical score 
5. Explore proteomic signatures of the clinical score 
6. Results interpretation and (optional validation in repeated samples)
